# Neopixels without Delay

since i needed to overwatch some input and still wanted to be able i took upon translating the other standard neopixel animations to a more friendly "no delay" format.

based on http://thebitchwhocodes.com/2014/12/22/avoiding-using-delay-in-arduino-neopixels/

quick and dirty extension of the other animations:

- colorWipe
- theaterChase
- rainbow
- rainbowCycle
- theaterChaseRainbow
